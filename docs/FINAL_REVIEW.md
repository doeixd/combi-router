   - Comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - Logical file organization

2. **Type Safety**
   - No `any` types without justification
   - Proper generic constraints
   - Type inference maximized
   - Discriminated unions for safety

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful error strategies

   - Bundle size optimization

### Areas of Excellence
- **Modularity**: Each module has a single, clear responsibility
- **Testability**: High test coverage with isolated unit tests
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and types
- **Consistency**: Uniform patterns throughout the codebase

## Performance Metrics

### Route Matching Performance
- Static routes: O(1) with map lookup
- Dynamic routes: O(n) linear search
- Optimized with early termination
- Pre-compiled regex patterns

### Memory Management
- Automatic cache cleanup
- Configurable cache limits
- Weak references for components
- Memory monitoring built-in

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree-shakeable design
- Code splitting support
- Development code stripped in production
- Minimal dependencies

## Compatibility
