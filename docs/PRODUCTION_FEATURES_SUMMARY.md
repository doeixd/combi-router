**Key Capabilities:**
- Monitors Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) automatically
- Provides intelligent prefetching based on user interaction
- Manages memory usage with configurable thresholds
- Adjusts behavior based on connection quality
- Tracks performance metrics and provides detailed reports

## üîß Integration Points

### Router Integration (`src/core/router.ts`)
- **Seamless integration** with existing navigation lifecycle
- **Feature managers** properly initialized and managed
- **Lifecycle hooks** for scroll restoration and performance tracking
- **Public API methods** for feature access and control
- **Graceful degradation** when features are disabled

### Type System Updates (`src/core/types.ts`)
- **Enhanced RouterOptions** with features configuration
- **Production feature interfaces** with complete type safety
- **Forward declarations** to prevent circular dependencies
- **Configuration interfaces** for all feature managers

### Export Structure (`src/index.ts`, `src/features/index.ts`)
- **Clean exports** of all production features
- **Aggregated interfaces** for easy configuration
- **Default configurations** for quick setup
- **Type re-exports** for convenience

## üìä Bundle Impact

### Build Results
- **ESM Development**: ~161 kB (with source maps: ~344 kB)
- **ESM Production**: ~78.8 kB (optimized)
- **CommonJS**: Similar sizes with format conversion
- **Tree-shakeable**: Features are optional and can be excluded

### Performance Benefits
- **Zero-impact when disabled**: Features add no overhead when not configured
- **Lazy initialization**: Feature managers only created when needed
- **Memory efficient**: Automatic cleanup and memory management
- **Connection-aware**: Respects user's network conditions

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Setup
```typescript
const router = createRouter(routes, {
  features: {
    scrollRestoration: { enabled: true },
    performance: { prefetchOnHover: true }
  }
});
```

### Advanced Configuration
```typescript
const router = createRouter(routes, {
  features: {
    scrollRestoration: {
      enabled: true,
      strategy: 'smooth',
      excludePaths: ['/admin']
    },
    codeSplitting: {
      strategy: 'route-based',
      preloadStrategy: 'hover',
      connectionAware: true
    },
    transitions: {
      enabled: true,
      type: 'view-transitions',
      fallbackTransition: 'fade'
    },
    performance: {
      prefetchOnHover: true,
      enablePerformanceMonitoring: true,
      preloadCriticalRoutes: ['home', 'dashboard']
    }
  }
});
```

### Feature Access
```typescript
// Access feature managers
const scrollManager = router.scrollRestoration;
const transitions = router.transitions;
const performance = router.performance;

// Setup element-based prefetching
const cleanup = router.setupHoverPrefetch(element, route);

// Get performance reports
const report = router.getPerformanceReport();
```

## üöÄ Production Readiness
